# coding-practice-actions â€“ CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Task Overview

The goal of this lab was to learn the basics of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) by setting up an automated workflow using GitHub Actions.

## Scope of Work

The steps completed during the lab included:

- Creating a new repository on GitHub.
- Setting up a local development environment using a virtual environment.
- Configuring a CI workflow using GitHub Actions, including steps for:
  - running unit tests,
  - performing static code analysis,
  - checking code formatting.
- Creating a Pull Request and verifying that all automated checks passed.
- Adding a new feature to convert natural numbers (0 to 100) to binary format. This was implemented using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach by:
  - first writing tests for the new functionality (including validation of input range and type),
  - then implementing the binary conversion function in a separate file,
  - finally integrating and testing the feature through the CI pipeline.
